# Paylocity-Assignment

This project showcases front-end, database, and back-end logic for a company trying to calculate the cost for employees and dependents.

# Technologies used
Front-end: Angular, CSS (Bootstrap), HTML, TypeScript
Back-end: C-Sharp
Database: SqlServer
Unit-Test: Jest

# Design
Based off the given information the design was implemented to show a wide range of different functionality.  No one part gets too specific as given the time to complete the assignment and the capacity of the development team (1 person) they felt it would be better to show off all parts in a basic way.
Examples are given for potential API calls to the server which would in turn call the database and retrieve information.  The main example would be loading in employees if a database existed with that companies employees so that the user on the client-side would have the ability to search of employees or even have autofill capabilities.
The front-end does most of the heavy lifting for this assignment as it handles all validations, saving, and submitting.  The UI is very simplistic and would definitely require assistance from a UX team to determine how best to lay out the page.

# Future Functionality
Given the time constraints and capacity, scope creep definitely seeped in many times during the development.  Additional functionality that would be nice to haves would be things like editing saved employees or deleting saved employees.  Much more validation logic needs to be put in place.  An Employee lookup window would be nice to have.  And much more.
